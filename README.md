# Scantist-Chrome-Extension
A chrome extension that highlights vulnerable packages to developers

As part of NYP's University Immersion Programme, I am assigned to NTU under Professor Liu Yang in the company Scantist to develop a secure chrome extension.

This Chrome Extension helps developers identify vulnerable packages easily, which aids in the development of a secure application.

Key Features
- Search Functionality
(User is able to query for specific packages, i.e. enter “jQuery 1.11.3” in the search bar - the chrome extension will then run some key algorithm and returns security information regarding that particular package)
- View Package Report
(Report Page will show in-depth details regarding the package, i.e. programming language, related CVEs, CVEs description etc)
